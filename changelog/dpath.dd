The `install.sh` script now respects the `$DPATH` environment variable

The `$DPATH` environment variable can be set on any system to make the install location of the install.sh script as well as other D related tools like DUB to store their cache files, dependencies, installed compilers, etc.

This way you can change where all the D tools are installed and keep a clean home folder.
